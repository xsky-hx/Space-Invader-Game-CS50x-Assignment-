# Space-Invader-Game-CS50x-Assignment-
This is a small Space Invader game created using Scratch as part of the CS50x course assignments. The goal of this project was to enhance my understanding of programming concepts such as the flow of commands and the basics of algorithms.

Game Features:
Player-controlled rocket movement
Collecting intact eggs to score points
Avoiding cracked eggs to prevent losing points
Key Learnings:
Gained a solid understanding of the flow of commands in a game loop
Applied basic algorithmic concepts to manage object interactions (egg collection and avoidance)
Used Scratch to visualize and implement the mechanics of the game
You can play the game https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/885928136.
